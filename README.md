# Robust-Matrix-Completion-based-on-Factorization-and-Truncated-Quadratic-Loss-Function (HOAT and HOMT)
In this paper, based on the factorization framework, we propose a novel robust matrix completion scheme via using the truncated-quadratic loss function, which is non-convex and non-smooth, and half-quadratic theory is adopted for its optimization. By introducing an auxiliary variable, half-quadratic optimization (HO) can transform the loss function into two tractable forms, that is, additive and multiplicative formulations. Block coordinate descent method is then exploited as their solver. Compared with the additive form, the multiplicative variant has lower computational cost since we attempt to take the observations contaminated by outliers as missing entries.
